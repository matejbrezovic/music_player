# MusicBee inspired music player

Made for a school project as well as my introduction to PyQt. 

User can:
  - add songs to database (either files separately or an entire directory tree),
  - play selected songs (shuffled, ordered, or repeating current song)
  - edit playing queue,
  - edit song's rating,
  - view (but not edit) other tags such as album, arist, year and genre,
  - sort by tracks by tags,
  - view embedded album cover and if it isn't present in the file it gets downloaded.

GUI is heavily inspired by MusicBee.
