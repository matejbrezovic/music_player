# MusicBee inspired music player

Made for a school project as well as my introduction to PyQt. 

User can add songs to database, edit playing queue, edit song's rating as well as view (but not edit) other tags such as album, arist, year and genre.
User can also view embedded album covers and if they aren't present in the file they get downloaded.

GUI is heavily inspired by MusicBee.
